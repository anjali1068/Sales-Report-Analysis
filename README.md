# Vrinda-Stores-2022-Annual-Sales-Report
This project focused on analyzing the sales data of Vrinda Stores for 2022. The project involved understanding the data, identifying business problems, and conducting data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values. A pivot table was created to summarize the data, and charts and graphs were used to visualize the findings. Finally, an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers was developed to present the results in a user-friendly manner. The report provides insights into customer behaviour, including gender-based purchasing patterns, top contributing states, age-gender relationships, channel analysis, and the highest-selling category. Recommendations are provided to enhance sales, such as targeting women customers, focusing on preferred sales channels, and prioritizing specific states. By implementing the recommendations, Vrinda Stores can optimize its marketing efforts and drive improved sales in 2023.
